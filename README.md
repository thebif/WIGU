Website for When I Grow Up

- This website was originally built as a platform to engage a group of high schools students in a campaign around the reality TV pilot, "When I Grow Up."
- The site is built primarily in HTML, CSS, and jQuery. It uses php for templating and SASS (with Bourbon and Neat) for CSS processing.
- The visual grid used in the layout is managed in jQuery to dynamically calculate grid section sizing (i.e. creating square grid sections)
- The site is very responsive in response to the usage patterns of the target audience. (In the campaign pilot, over 75% of users accessed the site on a smart phone.)
