                    <p><em>Ever feel like everybody keeps asking: What are you “going to do next”?</em></p>
                    <p>As students, how are we suppose to know that? We spend 13 years in school, learning good stuff (most of the time), but none of it informing what we do with our lives.</p>
                    <img src="../img/group-shot-01.jpg" alt="" />
                    <p>Should we go to college? Get some real world experience? Either way, where do we start? How do we discover what to study? What to explore?</p>
                    <p><em>Wouldn’t it be nice if we could “try on” a few different options?</em></p>
                    <p>Welcome to #whenigrowup, a reality TV show and community of young people exploring different dream careers. The show, When I Grow Up, features six young people; each gets to “try on” their dream job, finding out what its really like. In the first episode, we meet Jesse. He wants to be a chef, but things get wild when he sees everything involved in getting food from the farm to the table.</p> 
                    <p>Along with the show, a bunch of us &mdash; including the cast and crew of the show &mdash; are sharing our own journey from high school to college or jobs. We’re talking about what’s working, what’s real, and what is totally made up about this journey. </p>
