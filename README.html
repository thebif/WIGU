<h1>WIGU</h1>

<p>Website for When I Grow Up</p>

<ul>
<li>This website was originally built as a platform to engage a group of high schools students in a campaign around the reality TV pilot, &ldquo;When I Grow Up.&rdquo;</li>
<li>The site is built primarily in HTML, CSS, and jQuery. It uses php for templating and SASS (with Bourbon and Neat) for CSS processing.</li>
<li>The visual grid used in the layout is managed in jQuery to dynamically calculate grid section sizing (i.e. creating square grid sections)</li>
<li>The site is very responsive in response to the usage patterns of the target audience. (In the campaign pilot, over 75% of users accessed the site on a smart phone.)</li>
<li>The site uses fonts from Typekit (Freight Sans Pro, Freight Text Pro). They are accessible via Typekit only when served from the subdomain http://wigu.businessinnovationfactory.com/</li>
